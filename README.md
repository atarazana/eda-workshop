# Event-Driven Architecture Workshop

In the digital transformation strategies of companies, Serverless technologies, Event-Driven Architectures (EDA)
and data capture patterns (Change Data Capture) are gaining more strength every day.
 
Within this scenario, [Red Hat OpenShift Serverless](https://www.openshift.com/learn/topics/serverless),
[Red Hat AMQ Streams](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/amq),
[Red Hat Integration](https://www.redhat.com/en/products/integration),
[Red Hat Data Grid](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/data-grid),
and [Red Hat build of Quarkus](https://access.redhat.com/products/quarkus), offer companies
significant cost savings and multiple operational benefits by shifting infrastructure and
provisioning responsibilities to the different frameworks. This enables you
to solve problems quickly, at scale, and with high availability.

This repository includes a practical business example so that we can adopt modern and agile application
designs and implementations (containers, Serverless, streaming, etc.).

The logical architecture diagram of this use case is:

![Event-Driven Logical Architecture](./img/eda-logical-architecture.png "Event-Driven Logical Architecture")

At the end of the instructions you will have deployed a full Event-Driven Architecture with the
following deployment topology:

![Event-Driven Physical Architecture](./img/eda-physical-architecture.png "Event-Driven Physical Architecture in OpenShift")

This file include the list of steps to deploy easily this use case for your learning and testing efforts
about these amazing technologies and products.

**HINT**: If you want to deploy easily, we created a set of shell scripts with all the main
commands to deploy the infrastructure, applications and serverless services. Check the shell scripts in
the root of this repository.

## Prepare OpenShift

This architecture has been tested in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 version and the following
operators:

* Red Hat Integration - AMQ Streams 2.1.0
* Red Hat Integration - Service Registry 2.0.5
* Red Hat Data Grid 8.3.6
* Red Hat OpenShift Serverless 1.23.0
* Prometheus 0.56.3
* Grafana 4.4.1

As a normal user in your OpenShift cluster, create a ```eda-workshop``` namespace:

```shell
❯ oc login -u user
❯ oc new-project eda-workshop
```

This workshop requires deploy many different components and
it is needed to have enough resources. This workshop was
tested in "OpenShift 4.10 Workshop (Small)" Service provided
in the [Red Hat Product Demo System](https://rhpds.redhat.com/) with a single worker node of AWS
instance type `m5a.4xlarge`. Other node topologies and types should work.
